Builder
=======

Unity Build Pipeline Automation
Builder uses [MiniJSON by Calvin Rien] (https://gist.github.com/darktable/1411710)

Builder automates build process of Unity. It can automatically switch Build Options and included scenes for each build.

I am planning to add more features as I require more features. I do also encourage everyone to contribute the project as you see fit.
